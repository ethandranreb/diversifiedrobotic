# DR Social Spot -- A Diversified Robotic Web Dev Exam

This project uses Laravel and Vue.js for demonstration purposes.

- Laravel version 5.4 was used so that it maybe compatible with PHP 5.6 but (theoretically) should also be compatible with higher PHP versions.  
- Debug is enabled by default.
- node modules and vendor packages are included.  If any issues occur, please run npm install to update the node modules
- Please update the .env file accordingly
- Please run migrate to create the necessary database tables
- MySQL DB was used in the development for reference
- Some files do have documentation in the form of doc blocks.  Will be updating for further documentation if required. 
- HTTPS is disabled by default but can be enabled by editing the HttpsOnly middleware file and uncommenting line 22.
- The CSS and Javascript public files have been optimized for production.
- The root of the project directs to the login page.  A link to the registration page has been provided.
- Additional Javascript libraries should be compatible with most, if not all, modern browsers.
- uses Google Font CDN
- Bootstrap is installed as a node package
