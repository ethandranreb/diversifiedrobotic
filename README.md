# DR Social Spot -- A Diversified Robotic Web Dev Exam

This project uses Laravel and Vue.js for demonstration purposes.

- Laravel version 5.4 was used so that it maybe compatible with PHP 5.6 but (theoretically) should also be compatible with higher PHP versions.  
- Debug is enabled by default.
- node modules and vendor packages are included.  If any issues occur, please run npm install to update the node modules
